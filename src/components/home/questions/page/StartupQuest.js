                    <p>When you create a brand identity, you’re basically building a toolbox of visual elements to help you communicate effectively. This can be basic or extensive; it all depends on your brand’s needs. Regardless, every brand needs a basic identity, which includes three core elements: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logo</li>
                        <li>Color Palette</li>
                        <li>Typography</li>

                    <h3><b>(01)</b> Your foundation</h3>
                        <p>First, you need to know who you are: What’s your personality? What do you care about? What do you do? How do you talk about what you do? These are the core elements of your brand that your visual identity will communicate. </p>

                    <h3><b>(02)</b> Audit Your Competition</h3>
                    <p>it’s crucial to understand not just who your competition is but how your brand compares in terms of your visual presentation. Through a competitor audit, you can compare your brand to each competitor, and compare your competitors as a whole, which can surface some surprising insights. </p>

                    <h3><b>(03)</b> Write branding brief</h3>
                    <p>A brand brief is a comprehensive overview of exactly what your brand is, and isn't. It outlines the objectives, goals, values, and vision of your brand, allowing you to communicate the direction, purpose, and positioning of your business as clearly as possible.</p>
