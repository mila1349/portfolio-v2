                    <p >Website design is an important matter and should not be taken lightly. A well-designed website can help you form a good impression on your prospective customers. It can also help you nurture your leads and get more conversions.
                    But, more importantly, it provides good user experience and helps your website visitors access and navigate your website with ease.

                    <br ></br>
                    <p>So, if you are looking for designers to create your website, vet them well and ensure that they are capable of designing user-friendly and accessible websites.
                    If you already have a website, you can always conduct a site audit and optimize it to provide a better user experience and to improve accessibility.my goals are making good user experience that will make your visitor stay on your website.

                <h2>how does it work?</h2>
                <br></br>

                <h3><b>(01)</b> Tell me about your brand identity</h3>
                    <p>this step allows me to deliver the right message to enhance communication with the your customers and reinforce their trust with proper positioning. My ultimate goal is to create a set of visuals that will distinguish you from other businesses and satisfy the needs of your specific audience.</p>

                <h3><b>(02)</b> research</h3>
                <p>Share the lo-fi prototype with you and ask about your opinion. This is a back and forth process of delivering an idea and receiving feedback. Working on such prototypes gives you more freedom in applying changes than to do so on a live product.</p>

                <h3><b>(03)</b> design</h3>
                <p>This is the time to focus on colors and fonts, experiment with different layouts etc. making good design with great user experience and make it feasible for development.</p>
